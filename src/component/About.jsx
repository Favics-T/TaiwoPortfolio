Hi, I’m Kolapo Faith Taiwo, a passionate frontend developer and software engineering student focused on building responsive, accessible, and performance-driven web applications using React, Tailwind CSS, and JavaScript (ES6+).

I’m constantly improving my skills and exploring new technologies like TypeScript and Next.js to create scalable, modern solutions. Beyond coding, I love fashion design and sewing, which fuels my creativity and attention to detail.

When I’m not developing, I’m learning, contributing to projects, or sharing my journey online.
